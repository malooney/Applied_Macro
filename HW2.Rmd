## Problem 1

### a. In the Lucas Imperfect Information model, producers do not observe the aggregate price level perfectly. How does this model set up a signal extraction problem and how do firms solve it?






### b. What is the Lucas supply curve and what are its implications?  How is it different from the expectations-augmented Phillips curve?






### c. How do the implications of this model tie into the famous Lucas critique?
