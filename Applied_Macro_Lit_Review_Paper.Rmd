abstract: "
It has been estimated that the global financial (GFC) crisis has cost the world somewhere between $5-30 trillion USD. By any comparison this is a staggering loss and represents the most serious failure of economic systems since the 1920's. There were many reasons for the crisis, and analysis is ongoing, but what seems to be emerging as the leading cause of the crisis was the lack of macroeconomic models to account for major sections of the economy, mainly the housing sector and financial asset pricing. Just as important, but prehaps more theoretically challanging to address, are the lack of heterogeneity of economic agents, the lack of (or innappropriate) microfoundation underpinnings, and relaxing the requirement of rational expectations. The singular focus of macroeconomists and central bankers, pre-crisis, was on the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model (DSGE). None of the DSGE models were capable of alerting economists to the impending crisis.  
In this paper I examine the modeling paradigm pre-crisis and review the literature that has dawned as a result of the GFC. Much of this literature has been written by well-regarded macroeconomists and is highly critical of the field. The criticism cuts deep and results in a range of suggestions that include; adding elements to the DSGE framework to account for missing variables, to starting over with a completely new way to model complicated and emergent systems, ie. Agent Based Modeling.

## Introduction
  
  
\qquad Our ability to understand how and why the global financial crisis (GFC) occured is predicated on our ability to understand past financial crisis, which in turn shaped the current environment that allowed the most recent fincancial crisis. In some regard, financial crisis are cyclical. A financial crisis starts, regulators respond to the crisis by implementing policies to avoid future crisis. Economists develop new models to deal with the failing of the old models in the hopes of better predicting future crisis. Complacience sets in and regulations are picked appart which amplify the negative affects of the (more often than not) unintended consequences of well intended regulators. After sufficient time, a new crisis forms and the cycle starts anew.  
  
  
## Past Crisis - A very short history

\qquad Financial crisis are not a recent phenomina. Since the 1920's the United States has endured a number of them, including a large depression, a large recession, and everything in between. With each occurance regulators and economists spring to action with the hope of understanding, modeling and developing regulation to address future failings in the economic system. Less than one hundread years ago the U.S. was in the throws of the Great Depression. By the time the depression was over John Maynard Keynes had reformulated Alfred Marshalls partial equillibrium model with the inclusion of nominal rigidities. This reformulation required Keynes to invent several new concepts including liquidity preference, the consumption function and the multiplier. These components were necessary if Keynes was going to explain the Great Depression with his new ideas. However, Keynes' conceptual refurmulation would only go so far. A methodological reformulations was also needed if the ideas Keynes proposed were going to take hold in any meaningful way. John Hicks provided the necessary methods in his IS-LM model and the foundations for general equillibriam analysis were set forth.  
  
  
\qquad After the Great Resession the economy was slow to recovery but was helped along by the start of WWII. After the war was over the economy was humming and economists were hard at work continuing to refine and devolp additions to the IS-LM frmaework. Two influential papers on stabilization ploicy were written by Phillips (1954, 1957). These papers gave policy makers what they wanted; a link between the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation. If policy makers wanted lower levels of unemployment they could simply turn the lever and magically lower unemployment, albeit at a higher rate of inflation. The seeming sucess of the Phillips curve led to an explosion of empirical macroeconomic models including models developed by Frisch, Goldberger, Haavelmo, Klein, and Tinbergen. This work culminated in the first economy-wide macroeconomic model which was used to lend credibility to the macroeconomic policy making advicated for by the Phillips model.^[For a more detailed discussion of this model (the Federal Reserve System's MPS model) see Goodfriend and King [-@Goodfriend:1997ws] ]  
  
  
\qquad However, the sucess of the early macro-models were short lived. During the 1970's and 1980's a deep recession took hold. The recession was accomanyied by high levels of unemployment and high levels of inflation. According to the prevaling macroeconomic models in current use this should not have been possioble. Macroeconomists had a very public problem on their hands. As a result of this disparity between what the phillips curve predicted should be happeneing when unemployment was high and what was actually happening; the macroeconomists needed to refine their models and fast. This gave rise to what was to become known as the New Keynesian economics. Rather than start over with a completly new model the New Keynesians got to work adding complexity to their models to explain why we might see high inflation and high unemployment. Their focus, initially, was on the idea that wages and prices must be sticky. This sticyness of wages and prices could explain, why in the short run, it was possible to have both high unemployment and high inflation. In addition to the stickyness concept, New Keynsians poured a lot of effort into development of the Dynamic Stocastic General Equillibrium (DSGE) model, a model that was destined to take ceter stage in the macroeconomic revolution. The DSGE model incorporates elements of endogenous capital stock and investment and is a microfounded representative agent model. Since the model contains both supply and demand analysis and has elements of the labor market, money market, and equity market the model is a true general equillibrium model. There is no universially agreed upon formulation as to the exact mathematical structure of the DSGE model however, most of the DSGE models contain the same basic ingredients. A short exposisiton of the DSGE model is given in Appendix A.  
  
  
## The Global Financial Crisis and the DSGE Model
\qquad The trend in macroeconomics since the 1980's has been focused almost exclisivly on the DSGE model. The model has become more rich and complecated over the past several decades. As with any modeling paradigm, economic models are intended to provide simplified insight into very complicated situations and the DSGE model is no different in this regard. The problem with the DSGE model was that policy makers were starting to view this class of model in the same way they had viewed the Phillips curve type models pre Great Recession. Adding to the problem, economists were omitting key segments of the economy in an effort to keep the model tractable. However, this tractability came at a steep cost. In an effort to keep the DSGE models managable, economists were forced to make unresonable modeling assumptions. These assumptions alone were not a serious problem as long as the modelier and thoses seeking to use the model for policy perscriptions understand the models limitations. Either the assumptions associated with the DSGE model were not well understood or were simply ignored the end results was the same. A global economic recession took hold in the late 2000's. Although the reecssion was global in scale it is widly acknowledged that the recession originated in the Unites States and was centered around the subprime mortage crisis.  
  
  
\qquad As a direct result of the GFC the field of macroeconomics found itself in the hot seat once again. Similar to the past crisis, economists rolled up their sleves and started the process of pulling apart the crisis to understand where they had failed. However, this time economists are taking a more introspective approach when considering where exactly the models went wrong. This is partly brought on by the size and scope of the financial loss and party as a result of public outcry and congresisional investigation. Through this soul searching many well regarded economists in the field of macroeconomics have weighed in on where they feel the models have failed, how to make the DSGE models more realistic and robust and/or alternative modeling methods to employ that may better represent the global economy. Although there is some disagreement as to the excat approach, many economists agree of a set of approaches that should be taken to ensure a crisis on the scale of the GFC does not occur again, or at the very least we should be able to have some advanced warning that an impending crisis is looming.^[While many authors argue that the GFC was plainly obvios and the warning signs were simply ignored this does not explain the fact that none of the DSGE models in use were able to detect a looming crisis. While I do acknowledge that bad policy and corporate greed played a key role, the focus of this paper is to explore modeling prescriptions outside of policy, in particular I am interested in how the DSGE model failed and what the recomendations are moving forward.]  
  
  
## The Current Literature
### Four Primamry Recomendations to improve the DSGE Model

\qquad Through my analysis of key papers that have examined the failings of the DSGE model since the GFC four main themes seem to be consistent across many of them. These themes as summarized as follows^[A more extensive discussion of the general themes can be found in Vines and Wills.]:

  * ratehr than assume costless financial intermediation models need to incorporate financial frictions more realistically.

  * relax or eliminate the concept of rational expectations.
  
  * eliminate the assumption of the representative agent model in favor of heterogenious agents.
  
  * ground the models in more appropriate microfoundations.
  
  
\qquad The loudest critisism of the DSGE model has been the omission of financial frictions. This is an obvious first target considering the GFC started in the financial sector. This critisism is articulated in a paper by Hendry and Muellbauer [-@Hendry:2018jd]. While the authors critisism is focused on several different flavors of the DSGE model (most recently the DSGE COMPASS model) the take away from their paper is that all DSGE models failed to incorporate fincnacial frictions. As a way to incorporate frictions into the DSGE model, Blanchard [-@Blanchard:2018ki] suggests adding liquidity constraints. Others suggests adding elements to capture debt financied investments and a mechanish to represent the financial accelerator Carlin and Soskice(2018, 2014). Much of the literature has focused on incorporating some mechanish to capture detalied levels of financial friction. How exactly this is acomplished and to what degree are currently being debated in the literature. 

\qquad The rational expectations model has been a mainstay assumption in the macroeconomics literature since its introduction by John Muth in the 1960's. The ratioanl expectations ieda has become more of a way of thinking in the economics field

# Appendix A

### The New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equillibrium Benchmark Model (DSGE)

A simplified version of the New Keynesian DSGE Benchmark Model (hereafter NK-DSGE) is given by the following eight equations^[A more detailed exposition of the benchmark model can be found in Schmitt-Grohe´ and Uribe [-@schmitt2007optimal] ]:
\singlespace
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{{{C_t}}} = \beta {R_t}{E_t}\left( {\frac{1}{{{C_{t - 1}}}}} \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{w_t} = {\rm X}{C_t}L_t^\varphi
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{Y_t} = {Y_t}K_t^\alpha L_t^{1 - \alpha }
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{w_t} = (1 - \alpha )\frac{{{Y_t}}}{{{L_t}}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{R_t} = {E_t}\left[ {\frac{{\alpha \frac{{{Y_{t + 1}}}}{{{K_{t + 1}}}} + 1 - \delta  + ({Q_{t + 1}} - 1) + \frac{1}{{2\xi }}{{({Q_{t + 1}} - 1)}^2}}}{{{Q_t}}}} \right]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{I_t} = {K_{t + 1}} - (1 - \delta ){K_t} + \frac{\xi }{2}\frac{{{{({K_{t + 1}} - {K_t})}^2}}}{{{K_t}}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{Q_t} = 1 - \xi  + \xi \frac{{{K_{t + 1}}}}{{{K_t}}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{Y_t} = {C_t} + {I_t}
\end{equation}

where, $C$, $I$, $Y$, $L$, $K$, $w$, $R$, and $Q$ are consumption, investment, output, labor supply, capital stock, real wage, real interest rate (gross), and Tobin's Q, respectivly.

For simplicity, the individual consumers utility maximization problem is not explicitly shown. For the same reason, the representative firms profit maximization problem is not detailed. Equations 1-8 assume the first order conditions have been satisfied and equillibrium conditions exist. Another simplifying assumption is a constant labor force and the level of technology remains unchanged.
