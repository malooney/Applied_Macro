It has been estimated that the global financial crisis has cost the world somewhere between $5-30 trillion USD. By any comparison this is a staggering loss and represents the most serious failure of economic systems since the 1920's. There were many reasons for the crisis and after action analysis is ongoing but what seems to be emerging as one of the leading causes of the crisis was the lack of macroeconomic models to account for major sections of the economy, mainly the housing sector and financial asset pricing. The singular focus of macroeconomists and central bankers, pre-crisis, was on the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model (DSGE). None of the DSGE models were capable of alerting economists to the impending crisis.  
  
I plan to examine the modeling paradigm pre-crisis and review the literature that has dawned as a result of the crisis. Much of this literature has been written by well-regarded macroeconomists and is highly critical of the field. The criticism cuts deep and results in a range of suggestions that include; adding elements to the DSGE framework to account for missing variables, to starting over with a completely new way to model complicated and emergent systems, ie. Agent Based Modeling.
