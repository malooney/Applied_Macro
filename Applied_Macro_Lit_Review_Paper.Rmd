abstract: "
It has been estimated that the global financial (GFC) crisis has cost the world somewhere between $5-30 trillion USD. By any comparison this is a staggering loss and represents the most serious failure of economic systems since the 1920's. There were many reasons for the crisis, and analysis is ongoing, but what seems to be emerging as the leading cause of the crisis was the lack of macroeconomic models to account for major sections of the economy, mainly the housing sector and financial asset pricing. Just as important, but prehaps more theoretically challanging to address, are the lack of heterogeneity of economic agents, the lack of (or innappropriate) microfoundation underpinnings, and relaxing the requirement of rational expectations. The singular focus of macroeconomists and central bankers, pre-crisis, was on the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model (DSGE). None of the DSGE models were capable of alerting economists to the impending crisis.  
In this paper I examine the modeling paradigm pre-crisis and review the literature that has dawned as a result of the GFC. Much of this literature has been written by well-regarded macroeconomists and is highly critical of the field. The criticism cuts deep and results in a range of suggestions that include; adding elements to the DSGE framework to account for missing variables, to starting over with a completely new way to model complicated and emergent systems, ie. Agent Based Modeling.

\qquad Our ability to understand how the global financial crisis (GFC) occured is predicated on our ability to understand past financial crisis, which in turn shaped the current environment that allowed the most recent fincancial crisis. In some regard, financial crisis are cyclical. A financial crisis starts, regulators respond to the crisis by implementing policies to avoid future crisis. Economists develop new models to deal with the failing of the old models in the hopes of better predicting future crisis. Complacience sets in and regulations are picked appart which amplify the negative affects of the (more often than not) unintended consequences of well intended regulators. After sufficient time, a new crisis forms and the cycle starts anew.  
  
  
\qquad Financial crisis are not a new phenomina. Since the 1920's the United States has endured a number of them, including a large depression, a large recession, and everything in between. With each occurance regulators and economists spring to action with the hope of understanding, modeling and developing regulation to address future failings in the economic system. Less than one hundread years ago the U.S. was in the throws of the Great Depression. By the time the depression was over John Maynard Keynes had reformulated Alfred Marshalls partial equillibrium model with the inclusion of nominal rigidities. This reformulation required Keynes to invent several new concepts including liquidity preference, the consumption function and the multiplier. These components were necessary if Keynes was going to explain the Great Depression with his new ideas. However, Keynes' conceptual refurmulation would only go so far. A methodological reformulations was also needed if the ideas Keynes proposed were going to take hold in any meaningful way. John Hicks provided the necessary methods in his IS-LM model and the foundations for general equillibriam analysis were set forth.  
  
  
\qquad After the Great Resession the economy was slow to recovery but was helped along by the start of WWII. After the war was over the economy was humming and economists were hard at work continuing to refine and devolp additions to the IS-LM frmaework. Two influential papers on stabilization ploicy were written by Phillips (1954, 1957). These papers gave policy makers what they wanted; a link between the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation. If policy makers wanted lower levels of unemployment they could simply turn the lever and magically lower unemployment, albeit at a higher rate of inflation. The seeming sucess of the Phillips curve led to an explosion of empirical macroeconomic models including models developed by Frisch, Goldberger, Haavelmo, Klein, and Tinbergen. This work culminated in the first economy-wide macroeconomic model which was used to lend credibility to the macroeconomic policy making advicated for by the Phillips model.^[For a more detailed discussion of this model (the Federal Reserve System's MPS model) see Goodfriend and King [-@Goodfriend:1997ws] ]

### The New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equillibrium Benchmark Model (DSGE)

A simplified version of the New Keynesian DSGE Benchmark Model (hereafter NK-DSGE) is given by the following eight equations^[A more detailed exposition of the benchmark model can be found in Schmitt-Grohe´ and Uribe [-@schmitt2007optimal] ]:
\singlespace
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{{{C_t}}} = \beta {R_t}{E_t}\left( {\frac{1}{{{C_{t - 1}}}}} \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{w_t} = {\rm X}{C_t}L_t^\varphi
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{Y_t} = {Y_t}K_t^\alpha L_t^{1 - \alpha }
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{w_t} = (1 - \alpha )\frac{{{Y_t}}}{{{L_t}}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{R_t} = {E_t}\left[ {\frac{{\alpha \frac{{{Y_{t + 1}}}}{{{K_{t + 1}}}} + 1 - \delta  + ({Q_{t + 1}} - 1) + \frac{1}{{2\xi }}{{({Q_{t + 1}} - 1)}^2}}}{{{Q_t}}}} \right]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{I_t} = {K_{t + 1}} - (1 - \delta ){K_t} + \frac{\xi }{2}\frac{{{{({K_{t + 1}} - {K_t})}^2}}}{{{K_t}}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{Q_t} = 1 - \xi  + \xi \frac{{{K_{t + 1}}}}{{{K_t}}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{Y_t} = {C_t} + {I_t}
\end{equation}

where, $C$, $I$, $Y$, $L$, $K$, $w$, $R$, and $Q$ are consumption, investment, output, labor supply, capital stock, real wage, real interest rate (gross), and Tobin's Q, respectivly.

For simplicity, the individual consumers utility maximization problem is not explicitly shown. For the same reason, the representative firms profit maximization problem is not detailed. Equations 1-8 assume the first order conditions have been satisfied and equillibrium conditions exist. Another simplifying assumption is a constant labor force and the level of technology remains unchanged.
